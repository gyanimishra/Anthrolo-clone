## Lessons Learned

We are in our learning phase and this is my fourth clone, so faced multiple issues to build this site. These are some topic that challenges us to make this:-
- Playing with animation to get desired output
- Using javascript to manipulate the features
- Making custom features
- Using various styling method so that our clone could look as original as possible
